# Rigamarole 2018

Signup statistics from [The Rigamarole 2018](http://londonrigamarole.com/).

Relevant considerations for this data:

Registration opened on 28th January 2018.

The event was held from the 12th - 14th October.

Party passes were at full price for the entire duration of registration.

Full passes (party + classes) were at three different prices:

 * 'Earlybird' until 18th February
 * 'Earlyworm' until 4th March
 * Full price from 4th March onwards.

Registration was closed on September 22nd (a short time after the capacity was reached - we waitlisted a handful of leaders and couples in case of cancellations).

We had cancellation deadlines (and cancellations are NOT shown in this data) with the following schedule:

 * Full refund until end of May
 * 20% fee after 1st June
 * 50% fee after 1st September
 * No refund after 1st October

There were also a series of promotional blitzes on Facebook that varied in scope quite a bit. Yet more confounding factors :)
